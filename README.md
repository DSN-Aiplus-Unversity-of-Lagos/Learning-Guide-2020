# Learning Guide

Welcome to the DSN AI+ UNILAG Club Learning guide. Due to the pandemic, we would not be able to hold physial meetups so to aid learning for us all, a learning guide has been created to aid learning. It contains various links to Articles, Books, Courses, Documentation, and Videos.

The learning guide consists from the Basis of Python through Deep Learning. For beginners who don't know or have a idea about the Python Language, [Introduction To Python](IntroductiontoPython.md) can be checked for more insighs on Python. 

Also, for those who already have a knowledge of Python and want to diversify into various aspects of the application of Python, there are three aspects of the application of Python in this guide. These are:

- [Introduction to Data Science](DataScience.md)
- [Machine Learning](MachineLearning.md)
- [Deep Learning with Python](DeepLearning.md)

The Curriclum for the club can be found at: [DSN AI 2020 Curriculum](curriculum.md)
